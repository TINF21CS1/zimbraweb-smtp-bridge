# Zimbraweb-SMTP-Bridge in Docker

This Container allows users to send E-Mails via SMTP to a Zimbra Web Interface. It utilizes Postfix as receiver and the python package [zimbraweb](https://github.com/cirosec-studis/python-zimbra-web).

<span style="color: red;">This Container is still in development and should not be used in Production environments or for important E-Mails!</span>

â€¼ It only supports Plaintext E-Mails, and Attachments, but not HTML or RTF-Mails. This is due to a restriction in the Zimbra Webinterface<br />

## Public Bridge

There is a public server available at dhbw-mannheim.email at port 2525. Connect to it via SMTP with STARTTLS. For increased security we recommend hosting the Bridge yourself if you have a server available, [more on that below](#self-hosting). The public bridge is configured to automatically purge all data every 60 minutes. No logging data is written to disk at all, auth tokens (which are needed to authenticated with the Web Client) are kept only in memory and for 60 minutes at most, but in almost all cases will be deleted immediately after successful email delivery.

You can use the following settings:

IMAP (SSL/TLS): `studgate.dhbw-mannheim.de` at port `993`

SMTP (STARTTLS): `dhbw-mannheim.email` at port `2525`

Authenticate with the same credentials that you use for the Web Interface (--> without the @student.dhbw.mannheim.de part!)

You need to make sure your client sends emails in text/plain because Zimbra Web does not support HTML emails.

### Outlook

In Outlook, you should set your default mail format to "Plain Text" ("Nur Text") by going to File->Options->Mail ("Datei->Optionen->E-mail") and selecting "Plain Text" ("Nur Text") in the "Compose messages in this format" ("Nachrichten in diesem Format verfassen") dropdown.

### Thunderbird

Please note that lowering the minimum TLS version is requried because the Zimbra IMAP server uses outdated IMAP. There is sadly nothing we can do on our side to fix this. The SMTP Bridge uses up-to-date TLS.

In Thunderbird you should go to Acccount Settings, select "Composition & Addressing" in the Account and deselect "Compose messages in HTML format."

## Self-Hosting

To start the container use the following command

```
docker run --name smtp_bridge -p 587:587 ghcr.io/cirosec-studis/zimbraweb-smtp-bridge:nightly
```

### TLS Support

### Getting a certificate

To enable TLS you first need to generate a certificate. You can do this on the host machine using [`certbot`](https://certbot.eff.org/), here's how to do it in Ubuntu:

```bash
$ sudo apt install certbot
$ sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d <your-server-domain>
```

Follow the prompts. The certificate and key should end up in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<your-server-domain>/fullchain.pem` and `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<your-server-domain>/privkey.pem`. 

### Enabling TLS in the Container

The following commands assume your Docker container is named `smtp_bride`. Substitute as necessary.

Copy the certificate and key into the container:
```
# docker cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/<your-server-domain>/fullchain.pem smtp_bridge:/srv/zimbraweb/ssl_certificate.pem
# docker cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/<your-server-domain>/privkey.pem smtp_bridge:/srv/zimbraweb/private_key.pem
```

Enable TLS in the Container:
```
# docker run --it smtp_bridge /tls.sh
```

Follow the prompt again, you should be able accept the default values for the certificate and key location.

That's it, TLS is now enabled! Use STARTTLS on port 2525.

### Docker Tags

The following tags are available:

* `ghcr.io/cirosec-studis/zimbraweb-smtp-bridge:nightly` - This builds from `main` every night so that changes in the zimbraweb package are pulled into the container. Use this one to stay up to date.
* `ghcr.io/cirosec-studis/zimbraweb-smtp-bridge:latest` - Latest tagged build
* `ghcr.io/cirosec-studis/zimbraweb-smtp-bridge:vX.Y.Z` - Version X.Y.Z (e.g. v1.0.0)
* `ghcr.io/cirosec-studis/zimbraweb-smtp-bridge:develop` - development build



If you're on a raspberry pi, note the section [Docker on Raspberry Pi](#docker-on-raspberry-pi).

Optionally mount a logs directory by adding `-v /path/to/logs:/srv/zimbraweb/logs/`.

You can now connect to the container with your SMTP client at localhost:587.
To authenticate, use your Zimbra Webclient login credentials (without the @domain.tld part!).

### Docker on Raspberry Pi

Note that currently the alpine image does not work on raspberry pi without the following tweak:

```bash
# Get signing keys to verify the new packages, otherwise they will not install
rpi ~$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 04EE7237B7D453EC 648ACFD622F3D138

# Add the Buster backport repository to apt sources.list
rpi ~$ echo 'deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian buster-backports main contrib non-free' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-backports.list

rpi ~$ sudo apt update
rpi ~$ sudo apt install libseccomp2 -t buster-backports
```

This fix is from https://blog.samcater.com/fix-workaround-rpi4-docker-libseccomp2-docker-20/. Alpine requires libseccomp2>2.4.2 but on debian buster has 2.3.6, this fix installes a newer version from the backports repository.
